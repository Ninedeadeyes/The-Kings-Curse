# The-Kings-Curse
A mini text based adventure game written in C# 


A simple example of a text based adventure for any python coder who wants to have a look at how codes look like in C#.  Many examples I have found is much too complicated hence I wrote a simple text based adventure written with if,else statements and while loops. Exe folder included ( Please download all files in one folder to run )
